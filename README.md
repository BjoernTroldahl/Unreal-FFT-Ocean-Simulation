# Unreal-FFT-Ocean-Simulation
All the C++ scripts used for generating inverse Fast Fourier Transform ocean waves in real-time for Unreal Engine 5.3.

The scripts also ensure adpative tessellation based on the camera's distance to the waves, and movable run-time buoyancy for sailing any vessel on top of the waves. 

Included is also a batch file that automates rebuilding from source of the Unreal C++ project, whenever you double-click it.
